## How It Works

The Password Generator uses JavaScript to dynamically create random passwords based on the user's preferences. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- The character sets for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are defined at the beginning of the JavaScript code.
- The user's input for password length and option selections is captured.
- When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the script concatenates the selected character sets to create an initial set of characters to choose from.
- A random password is generated by selecting characters from the initial set based on the specified length.
- The generated password is displayed in the designated input field.
